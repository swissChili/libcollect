{\ttfamily libcollect} is a C library of useful collection types. So far I have only implemented a hash map. Because this is C these types are pretty unsafe and use {\ttfamily void $\ast$}s everywhere. The pointers these containers store should be allocated on the heap as they will be freed when the containers are freed.
